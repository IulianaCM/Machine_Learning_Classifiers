# Machine_Learning_Classifiers
### This is a small project for better understanding the machine learning algorithms.
### There are two classes of objects, images in this case, stored in two different folders. I used images found on Kaggle for testing different algorithms for this particular dataset and see their performances.
### The classes I used contains images of bees and butterflies. There is a training dataset containing both classes in separate folders and a testing dataset containing some images with bees and butterflies stored together.
